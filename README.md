# AWS-Resilience-Hub-Workshop
AWS Resilience Hub Workshop - Project to deploy a workload and utilize Aws Resiliency hub to test and improve capabilities

The objective of this lab is to deploy a workload and use AWS Resilience Hub to measure its resiliency.
You will learn to use recommendations provided by Resilience Hub to make improvements to the
workload and ensure it meets the resiliency targets you are looking for. You will also perform Chaos
testing on the workload using AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) to measure the effectiveness of
workload improvements by intentionally inducing failure and seeing how the workload responds. By the
end of the lab you should have an understanding of how Resilience Hub can be used to measure and
improve your application resilience.
1. Deploy the workload.
2. Add and assess application using AWS Resilience Hub.
3. Resiliency findings and recommendations.
4. Operational recommendations.
5. Chaos testing with AWS Fault Injection Simulator.
